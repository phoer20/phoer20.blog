Today I learned how to add a second page to my website. I will start to put my
blog posts in their own page and try to design them and make them appealing.
My next goal is to learn css and incorporate that into my HTML. This self taught
project is actually pretty fun. The problem I had earlier with adding a picture
to the website, I was able to get it working after 3 days of trial and error,
and a lot of Googling.
