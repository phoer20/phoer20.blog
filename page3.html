(6/13/22)

Today I realized that I should probably start adding the dates to the posts
because I would like to track the progress I have made and in what time frame.
I was at work, thinking about what I was going to do next on my website. I hope
this is not an obsession, but a passion that I enjoy. I cannot wait until the
final piece is done so that I can move to my next project. I have had so many
ideas about websites for NFTs and stuff like that so I am excited to see where
this journey takes me!
