It is time to learn a new skill and adapt to the future!
We are beginning to lean towards an internet dominant society.
We have to protect ourselves and make sure we are safe from any
malicious attacks. Weather that be cyber attacks or physical
attacks from foreign nations. These are the things we need to
do to protect ourselves!

This website is starting to get the bast of me lol. I am so lost when it comes do
directories. I am trying to add an image and it has been a pain in my ass since
last week. I took a couple day break but I am back at it and trying my best to
get this up and running so I completly understand the process. I am not sure if
I would want a coding job but I am enjoying this challenge that I gave myself.
I hope it translates into the real world and I can put my newly learned skills to
good use!
