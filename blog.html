It is time to learn a new skill and adapt to the future!
We are beginning to lean towards an internet dominant society.
We have to protect ourselves and make sure we are safe from any
malicious attacks. Weather that be cyber attacks or physical
attacks from foreign nations. These are the things we need to
do to protect ourselves!

All jokes aside, I am excited to do this project! Everytime I get behind a
keyboard, I want to learn something new. I gave up on trying to figure out why
Ubuntu wouldn't run on my Virtual Box but whatever, I think I can do more in the
crypto and NFT world designing websites and understanding the backend. A couple
months back, I started messing around with Python and I loved it but because of
work and stuff, I got too busy and going back to it, it's like I have to relearn
all of it again. I guess this isn't a skill you can just learn once and give up,
you have to constantly be learning and practicing and repeating. I am estimating
that this project will probably take about a month, depending on how detailed I
want it to be, but I do want it to look presentable and seem like a legit company
made it or something along those lines. Anyways! Talk to you soon!!
